            <h2><strong>All About Worms!</strong></h2>

            <p>Worms are the next class of animals we will be exploring in this zoology class. All worms contain bilateral symmetry which means that we can draw an imaginary line across the body plane from top to bottom which would result in identical left and right sides. Some worms also contain two body openings, a mouth at the top and anus at the bottom. Worms are some of the first animals to develop a full digestive tract! There are three main types of worms: Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, and Annelida.

                <h2>Platyhelminthes- Flatworms</h2>
               <p> Platyhelminthes are also referred to as Flatworms because they are completely flat animals. Flatworms also have a simple brain and can sense things like light. Flatworms have a simple group of nerve cords called the ganglia which serves as a primitive brain. Flatworms are predators and eat food by using their primitive mouth called the pharynx. Think of the pharynx as a straw-like structure that is released to suck up food. The flatworm has one opening that also releases waste once digested. Flatworms can reproduce sexually or asexually. Many students find regeneration to be a very interesting thing to study in class! Flatworms can be cut in half and completely regenerate into two organisms.

                <h2><strong>Nematodes(Roundworms) and Annelida (Segmented Worms)</strong></h2>
                
                <p>Nematodes and Annelids both contain bilateral symmetry and a digestive system with a full digestive tract. Many nematodes and annelids are parasites that infect a host to obtain food. Both of these animals contain two openings, the first serving as the mouth and the second serving as the anus. Nematodes are born either male or female and can only reproduce sexually. Nematodes have smooth non-segmented bodies with one end tapered to a point. Nematodes have longitudinal muscles that allow for some basic movement.
                
                Segmented worms are defined by their segments seen along the length of their bodies. Segmented worms are the most advanced type of worm. They can sense light like the others but can also sense things like chemicals and moisture as they diffuse through their skin. Segmented worms also have a complete circulatory system and contain several pairs of hearts. Students that have used worms as bait fishing may have noticed evidence of a circulatory system! Segmented worms also have several muscles such as the crop and gizzard that resonate with chewing and features seen in other animals. Segmented worms contain both male and female parts and can reproduce sexually or asexually, this varies by the species.
