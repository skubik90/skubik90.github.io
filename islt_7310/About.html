            <h3>About Me!</h3> 
            <p> My name is Scott Kubik and I am currently a science teacher at <em>Orchard Farm High School</em>. I attended the University of Missouri graduating in 2013 with a Bachelor’s of Science Degree in Chemistry and Secondary Education. I completed my Master's degree in Learning, Teaching, and Curriculum through the University of Missouri as a member of Partnership for Educational Renewal (MPER), Fellow's Program. In this program I was placed as a teacher at Jefferson City High School while completing my Masters Degree at the University of Missouri. I am currently working on my Educational Specialist Degree (EdS) in Learning Technologies and Design through the University of Missouri. I hope to continue as a classroom teacher but am open to seeking additional opportunities if they arise upon graduation.</p></div>
