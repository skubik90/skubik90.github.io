            <h2><strong>Porifera-Sponges</strong></h2>

            <p>Porifera are some of the simplest animals in the animal kingdom. Porifera are more commonly referred to as sponges. Sponges are sessile for their adult life which means they are stationary. Many scientists believed at one point that these animals were plants since they resemble plants and are stationary for most of their life spans. Sponges can reproduce sexually or asexually. Sponges reproduce asexually by budding, where a piece of the sponge breaks off and a new but identical organism grows. Sponges can reproduce sexually by releasing sperm into the water and fertilizing the egg of another sponge. Since sponges are sessile they cannot move to obtain food. Sponges Are filter feeders, meaning they obtain food by filtering nutrients from water. Sponges use specialized cells to bring water through their ostia(pores),  filter out food such as algae or small bacteria, and push out waste. Waste is pushed out through their osculum which looks like the open circular domed open areas on most sponges.</p>
