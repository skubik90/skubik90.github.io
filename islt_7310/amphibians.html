            <h2><strong>Amphibians</strong></h2>
               <p> Amphibians are a very unique class of animal to study because they undergo many changes between two stages of their life cycle. The word amphibians means “double life” which refers to the two life cycles an amphibian undergoes over the course of its life. The first half of the life cycle of an amphibian is spent in the water and the second half is spent on land. During its metamorphosis we see many changes in the anatomy of a frog or other amphibians. The frog begins its life as a tadpole using gills to obtain oxygen from water for respiration. In its adult stage the gills develop into lungs that allow them to pull in oxygen through the skin to their lungs located on the lining of their mouth. We also see changes in the changes in the tail of a tadpole developing into legs for further mobility in the adult version. There are also changes that take place in a two chambered heart becoming a three chambered heart over the course of metamorphosis. Amphibians also include animals such as animals such as the salamander and toads which also undergo metamorphosis.</p>
