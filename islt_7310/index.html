                <h3><strong>Hello! Welcome to Mr. Kubik's Classroom Website!</strong></h3>  


                <h3> <strong> About Me and My Website!</strong></h3>


                <p>My name is Scott Kubik, I am a science teacher in the Orchard Farm School District. I have been teaching science for 10 years. In my teaching career I have taught Physics, Forensics,Zoology, and Chemistry.This website will allow students to learn more about the classes they are taking with me in class.This website will be updated on a regular basis for students to keep up with assignment due dates and other important information. Students can use the website to keep track of assignments and their due dates. Students can use the “Let's Learn” page to get some additional background information about certain topics we are learning about in class.</p>

                <p>In addition to teaching at Orchard Farm, I am the head coach for the boys golf team and sponsor of the Game Club at school. These activities keep me busy throughout the school year but I enjoy working with my students. I love watching our players compete in golf events and working with them each day at practice. Game Club is another great way I interact with students during the school day. Once a week the students meet and play video games or other competitive based activities. Students have a lot of fun attending our weekly meetings.</p>
                                    
                <p>In my personal life I have been married to my wife Jessica for three years. We recently had our first child, Dillon in April of 2023. Our one-year-old son keeps us very busy, but we are loving our new experience as first time parents!</p>
