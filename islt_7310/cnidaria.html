            <h2><strong>Cnidaria- Jellyfish, Sea Anemone, Hydra, etc./strong></h2>

            <p> Cnidaria are the next phylum of the animal kingdom we will study in class this year! Cnidaria are characterized by their one sac-like body with one opening and stinging cells and tentacles. Cnidaria’s bodies are made of two layers, the Endoderm(inside layer)  and the Ectoderm (outside layer). In between these layers is a gel-like layer called the mesoglea which provides support to the organism. Cnidaria are predators and use their tentacles to sting and pull in food through their single opening into their gastrovascular cavity. Food is broken down in the gastrovascular cavity and nutrients are absorbed into cells and waste products are released through the same single opening. Many cnidaria have two body forms, the polyp and medusa versions. In their polyp life cycle the cnidaria is sessile with their tentacles facing upwards and their mouth at the top. The medusa form is the “jelly fish” version that is free moving with the tentacles and mouth facing downwards. Cnidaria reproduce both sexually and asexually. In asexual reproduction a bud is broken off of the polyp life form producing an identical new medusa free moving version like the jellyfish. Cnidaria can also produce sexually by releasing sperm in water to fertilize the egg of another organism. In jellyfish the sexual reproduction results in a polyp version and asexual reproduction results in the adult jellyfish version seen freely moving.</p>
